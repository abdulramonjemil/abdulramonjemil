<h1 align="center">Hi friendðŸ‘‹,</h3>

I'm Abdulramon Jemil, a web developer, computer enthusiast and technical writer. I got into the field of programming as a result of the lockdown in 2020. I like to read and write about computers and everything that revolves around them. I hope to dive into Open Source very soon.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **"JavaScrit for Starters"**, a course on JavaScript which I'm preparing for total beginners to the field of JS and it's impact on the web. I hope to complete this very soon.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading *Eloquent JavaScript* by *Marijn Haverbeke*. It has been a very good read.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me on Twitter [@abdulramonjemil](https://twitter.com/abdulramonjemil).

- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript with just my Android phone, and didn't get a widescreen device for coding until after about 18 months.
